# rb3-xenon decomp — state, lever landscape & research roadmap (2026-06-09)

**Operating model:** Claude coordinates + manages context; implementation is delegated
to **workflows** (`.claude/workflows/*.js`, run via the Workflow tool). Tooling is the
product — every manual/agent pass must report tooling gaps + ideas. This is a research
feedback loop: form a hypothesis → build/run a tool → measure → record verdict.

## Current state (main `ce16bfa`)
- **6568 / 65548 functions matched** (4.93% of whole binary; 6.88% fuzzy).
  Oracle-backed tier ~8.4% matched. Session moved 6386→6568 (+182).
- Honest near-miss pool `[90,100)%` after the true_progress classifier fix
  (`50faab6`): **FRAME_ONLY 445** (funclet-gated, downstream metric), **STRUCT_WORK
  667** (real layout pool), **CODEGEN_WORK 217** (permuter-class), RECOVERABLE/CLEAN ~14.

## Lever landscape — what's TAPPED vs LIVE (hypotheses tested this campaign)

### Refuted / dead (do NOT re-attempt — proven negatives)
- **"Retail is an LTO/LTCG build hiding matches"** — REFUTED (4 signatures). No whole-
  program opt; TUs are contiguous. The asymmetry vs dc3 is the missing **map**, not opts.
- **Funclet "+615 tooling lever"** — REFUTED. FRAME_ONLY = parent-gated funclets (resolve
  free as parents match) + misclassified real work. 0 pure-name-reloc. jeff is NOT buggy
  (clamp/prune already fixed it). objdiff bl-by-name fix flips ~0. (`feedback_fuzzy_gap`.)
- **gameport via TU-cluster pinning** — DEAD for scattered band3 TUs (10/10 negative).
  Coverage-stub mirage + scattered fns; no contiguous cluster to pin.
  (`project_game_code_instrumentation`.)
- **Spatial bracketing on the rb3-Wii byte-oracle** — DEAD (114/116 known pins have 0
  oracle self-agreement; produces confident-WRONG spans).
- **Permuter on hard regalloc residuals** — ~0 even with m2c/BSF installed.
- **Struct-layout grind on top engine units** — largely EXHAUSTED (headers already
  correct; engine-easy-wins 14 agents → only the Str force-multiplier).

### Live levers (yield this session)
- **Engine force-multipliers** = "DC3 (newer) diverged from RB3" patterns. Three sub-types,
  each a header/cpp fix that flips MANY callers:
  1. **Inline-policy divergence** — DC3 inlined what retail kept out-of-line (or vice
     versa). `Str::operator==/!=(const String&)` out-of-line → **+6** (`ce16bfa`); the
     `DataArray::Node` keystone earlier. **HIGH EV, repeatable, under-mined.**
  2. **DC3-dropped/added member** — re-add/remove a member to match retail layout:
     `CharSleeve/CharIKSliderMidi mMe` +3, `Gem::Tail` pad +1, postproc pad +1.
  3. **Ground-truth data constants** — save/load revs: `PostProcer SAVE_REVS(1,0)→(0,0)`
     +1 (1-off, not repeatable — only instance found).
- **DC3 byte-identical fingerprint transfer / reveal** — drained this session (+161 early)
  but REFILLS as the swarm body-ports (reveal cascade).

### In-flight experiment (workflow `gameid-crossval`, run `wf_3505a3ec-069`)
- **Game-ID = improve the per-fn LABEL** (the bottleneck), then bracket TU spans.
  Two compiler-robust signals, CALIBRATED on the 25 known game pins, cross-validated:
  - **BinDiff (modified)** — source at `../bindiff` (buildable; `../binexport` cloned).
    Mods: mask 32/40-byte coverage stubs + seed the 627 pins as **fixed points** so the
    call-graph + string-ref passes propagate. Stock bindiff already produced the noisy
    `unified_id_rb3wii.json`; the mods are the untested lift.
  - **BSim** — Ghidra decompiler p-code similarity (compiler-robust; same PPC family).
- **Open research question (the gate):** does cross-arch BSim / anchored-BinDiff actually
  re-locate the 25 known pins (precision/recall)? If neither calibrates, game-ID via these
  signals is a negative result. If yes: ~15-40 game TUs / 300-1000 fns become *locatable*
  (locating ≠ matching — matching is the downstream per-fn grind).
- **Caveat in play:** RB3Xenon Ghidra project is locked by an in-progress import; the
  workflow degrades to rb3-Wii-side artifacts + reports the target side blocked if so.

## Tooling — built/fixed vs gaps
**Built/fixed this campaign:**
- `m2c` + `BSF` permuter backends installed+wired (`9763683`): `tools/objdiff_to_m2c.py`,
  `tools/compiler_trace/`, decomp-synth.json. (Validated; permuter still hit-or-miss.)
- `tools/true_progress.py` FRAME_RECON classifier fixed (`50faab6`) — honest buckets.
- Game-ID pipeline (`.claude/workflows/gameid-crossval.js`) + bindiff/binexport build path.

**Tooling GAPS / ideas to explore (the feedback-loop backlog):**
1. **Force-multiplier finder** (HIGH EV) — a tool that scans engine near-misses for the
   3 "DC3-diverged" patterns (inline-policy flips, dropped/added members via uniform
   member-offset deltas, save-rev constants) and ranks them, instead of per-unit agent
   recon. The Str/CharSleeve/Gem wins were all found by hand; automate the detection.
   Signal sources: objdiff uniform-offset-delta detection + cross-ref DC3 header inline
   bodies vs retail out-of-line `bl` (the Str pattern is mechanically detectable).
2. **Inline-policy diff** — diff DC3 headers' inline method bodies against retail's
   out-of-line/inline choice per function (detectable: target `bl <fn>` where our build
   inlined the body). This is sub-type 1 above, the highest-yield repeatable lever.
3. **Reveal-cascade refill monitor** — re-run reveal/relocate/pin as the swarm lands
   body-ports (it refills); currently manual.
4. **Game-ID tool** (gated on the calibration verdict) — if BSim/bindiff-mod calibrates,
   productionize it (`tools/`) as the standing game-TU locator.
5. **Permuter is not the bottleneck** — CODEGEN_WORK 217 is genuinely hard; deprioritize.

## Prioritized next experiments (workflow queue)
1. **Integrate `gameid-crossval` results** — pin any HIGH-confidence cross-validated game
   TUs; record the calibration verdict (science: did the signals work?).
2. **Build + run the force-multiplier finder** (gap #1/#2) → feed an `engine-forcemult`
   workflow targeting inline-policy + dropped-member flips across ALL engine units (not
   just the top STRUCT_WORK ones — Str came from DirLoader recon, not a top unit).
3. **DC3-source wiring residual** — vet the ~remaining real (non-vendor, non-Kinect)
   unwired engine `.cpp` for byte-identical clusters (UIListProvider was +9).
4. **Reveal refill** after each body-port wave.
